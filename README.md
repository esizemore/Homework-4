# Homework-4
1. RADIOACTIVE DECAY: This exercise looks at a more advancedversion of the simple radioactive decay simulation
  a. For each atom, decide at random, with the appropriate probability whether it decays or not. Count the total number that decay, subtract it from the number of atoms, and add it to the following isotope. 
  b. Similar to a, but for a different isotope
  c. Count the numbersthat decay by each route and add and subtract accordingly
  
2. Monte Carlo Integration: Calculate a value for the integral
  a. show that the probabiltiy distribution p(x) is given by p(x)=1/(2*x^.5) and derive a transformation formula for getting random numbers between zero and one from this distribution
  b. Sample 1 million random points and evaluate the integral. You should get around 0.84
3. Create projects for all previous hw and place a readme file with descriptions of each file added into project.
